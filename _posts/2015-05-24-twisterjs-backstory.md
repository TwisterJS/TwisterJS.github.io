I thought it would be good to give a little backstory on TwisterJS -- a little bit more than what is on the [About page](http://twisterjs.github.io/about/).

TwisterJS is an open source project by me, [Carmen Long](http://www.twitter.com/carmalou). I came up with this idea because the kiddos at Tulakes Elementary are some of the poorest kids in this district. They are all on free lunches through a grant, and frequently on some sort of aid at home -- SNAP, SoonerCare, or something similar.

There aren't many opportunities for learning technology for these kiddos. While they have iPads in the classroom, a lot of the kids don't have wifi at home -- or even a computer. Usually someone in the home will have a smartphone with a data plan.

This is where I got the idea for a mobile app -- I wanted the kids to be able to learn in and out of school. So I knew it needed to be available for iOS and Android.

I spoke to some teachers about my idea, and there was a little skepticism at first. They told me that it wasn't something they would be able to teach, so a goal was that the app could teach a teacher as well as a student.

After working with the students, I learned that I needed to create a website to complement the apps.

All in all, I have a busy summer ahead of me, building more apps and creating a website for all of the games and learning.
