I'm happy to announce that TwisterJS was featured on Ionic's blog! You can read the full post [here](http://blog.ionic.io/teaching-mobile-development-with-ionic/).

I'm so honored that everyone is so excited and enthusiastic about this project. Thank you so much! I'm currently working with Tulakes to get back into the classroom and test with more students before moving forward to put the first app on to the App Store. But I am getting very, very close.

Please check back often, and I'll keep everyone updated!

Thank you again, and please feel free to email with any questions.
