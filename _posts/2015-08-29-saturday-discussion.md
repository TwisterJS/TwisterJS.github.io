This morning I had the privilege of leading [Code Newbies](http://www.codenewbie.org/) [Saturday Discussion](http://www.codenewbie.org/blogs/saturday-discussion). (You can watch it [here](https://plus.google.com/events/c3rtn7g5g3ott25mnqigkmlp490)).

I demoed the HTML app, as well as explained the frameworks I used to build the app. I used Angular and Ionic, both of which are JavaScript frameworks. Angular is a frontend JavaScript framework that integrates beautifully both with the HTML and with Ionic.

Ionic is what I am using to create the mobile application itself. Angular is providing the functionality, while Ionic is what actually builds the JavaScript into Android and iOS apps.

I'm really glad to have had the opportunity to display the app, and answer questions about it. Some of the viewers had questions about Angular and Ionic and I was glad to be able to share my knowledge with others. That's what TwisterJS is really all about!

I was also glad to make a few great connections with like-minded individuals, and hopefully the opportunity to get TwisterJS into other school districts in Oklahoma.

If you didn't tune in, you should definitely check out the recording, and feel free to [tweet me](https://twitter.com/carmalou) any questions you might have about the project.
