I am pleased to announce that we had a successful first round of alpha testing this week!

I was in a bit of a rush getting the first app to a testable state. School was letting out very soon, so I didn't have much time for students to test the app.

The code for the app is [TwisterJS: HTML for Beginners](http://www.github.com/TwisterJS/htmlApp). This app includes a video, two games, and a short glossary of HTML tags. [You can run the app in your browser here.](http://TwisterJS.github.io/htmlApp/www)

I decided to do a mobile app as our first project because several of the students we were targeting don't have Internet or even computers at home. Although, family members frequently have smartphones. 

On the other end of the spectrum, each student has an iPad in the classroom.

With hopes of reaching as many students as possible, I decided that a mobile app would be the way to go.

When I first approached teachers about teaching their students HTML, I was met with some uncertainty. The teachers weren't sure the kids would be able to do it. But I assured them that if they would allow me to test the app with the kids, the kids would pick it up, and I would be there to help.

After a long weekend of coding, commits, testing, and then more coding, more commits, more testing (and let's be honest, a little anxiety and a few tears), the app was finally ready for the kids!

I spent half the day with a class of 5th graders Monday. I'm so thankful for the opportunity to enter the classroom and spend time with the kids as they took their first steps into tech. I got some wonderful insights from this experience, including a few new project ideas!

Overall, the day was a huge success. We started off in the classroom watching the video and playing some of the games. Next we downloaded a text editor to their iPads, and let them try out building a few HTML pages themselves. After lunch, a few students and I sat down at computers to keep practicing and building.

I spoke with a teacher at the end of the day about making an ongoing program next year, and she was very excited about the idea. I'll keep you posted on this! For now, I'm just going to keep working on the HTML app, and begin an online game for students as well.
