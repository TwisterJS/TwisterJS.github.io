TwisterJS is an open source project dedicated to teaching underprivileged children about tech. We create mobile apps, as well as spend time in the classroom working directly with children.

All of our projects are available on our [GitHub page](http://www.github.com/twisterjs), along with documentation on how to edit and use the apps.

The project is the brainchild of Carmen Long. You can find her tweeting as [Carmalou](www.twitter.com/carmalou) and coding [here](http://www.github.com/carmalou).
